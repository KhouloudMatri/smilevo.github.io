abstract: 'Despite the availability of refactoring as a feature in popular IDEs, recent studies revealed that developers are reluctant to use them,
and still prefer the manual refactoring of their code. At JetBrains, our goal is to fully support refactoring features in IntelliJ-based
IDEs and improve their adoption in practice. 
Therefore, we start by raising the following main questions. How exactly do people refactor code? What refactorings are the most popular? Why do some
developers tend not to use convenient refactoring tools provided by modern IDEs?
In this paper, we investigate the raised questions through the design and implementation of a survey targeting 1,183 users of
IntelliJ-based IDEs. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the survey results shows that almost two-thirds of developers spend
more than one hour in a single session refactoring their code; that refactoring types vary greatly in popularity; and that a lot of developers would like to know more about IDE refactoring features but
lack the means to do so. These results serve us internally to support the next generation of refactoring features, as well as can help our
research community to establish new directions in the refactoring usability research.'
