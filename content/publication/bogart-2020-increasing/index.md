abstract: 'In software development, maintaining good design is essential. The process of refactoring enables developers to improve this design during development without altering the
programâ€™s existing behavior. However, this process can be time-consuming, introduce semantic errors, and be difficult for developers inexperienced with refactoring or unfamiliar with a given code base. Automated refactoring tools can help
not only by applying these changes, but by identifying opportunities for refactoring. Yet, developers have not been quick to adopt these tools due to a lack of trust between the developer and the tool. We propose an approach in the form of a
visualization to aid developers in understanding these suggested operations and increasing familiarity with automated refactoring tools. We also provide a manual validation of this approach and identify options to continue experimentation.'
