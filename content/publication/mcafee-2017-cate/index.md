abstract: 'Like all software systems, Android applications are not immune to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and a wide range
of other runtime errors. Concolic analysis, a hybrid software verification technique which performs symbolic execution along
with a concrete execution path, has been used for a variety of purposes including software testing, code clone detection, and
security-related activities. We created a new publicly available concolic analysis tool for analyzing Android applications: Concolic Android TEster (CATE). Building on Java Path Finder
(JPF-SPF), this tool performs concolic analysis on a raw Android application file (or source code) and provides output in a useful
and easy to understand format'
