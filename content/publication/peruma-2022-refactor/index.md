abstract: 'An essential part of software maintenance and evolution, refactoring is performed by developers,
  regardless of technology or domain, to improve the internal quality of the system, and reduce its technical
  debt. However, choosing the appropriate refactoring strategy is not always straightforward, resulting in
  developers seeking assistance. Although research in refactoring is well-established, with several studies
  altering between the detection of refactoring opportunities and the recommendation of appropriate code
  changes, little is known about their adoption in practice. Analyzing the perception of developers is critical
  to understand better what developers consider to be problematic in their code and how they handle it.
  Additionally, there is a need for bridging the gap between refactoring, as research, and its adoption in
  practice, by extracting common refactoring intents that are more suitable for what developers face in reality.
  In this study, we analyze refactoring discussions on Stack Overflow through a series of quantitative and
  qualitative experiments. Our results show that Stack Overflow is utilized by a diverse set of developers for
  refactoring assistance for a variety of technologies. Our observations show five areas that developers typically
  require help with refactoringâ€“ Code Optimization, Tools and IDEs, Architecture and Design Patterns, Unit
  Testing, and Database. We envision our findings better bridge the support between traditional (or academic)
  aspects of refactoring and their real-world applicability, including better tool support'
