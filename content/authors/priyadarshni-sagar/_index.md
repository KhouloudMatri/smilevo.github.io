I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. My course work is closely related to Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Software Development. I believe every problem can be solved if approached systematically. My undergraduate degree in Information Technology has equipped me with the requisite skill of recognizing and defining the structure of the problem. The next step is to analyze the problem and solve it. This is where my degree in Data Science comes into the picture. Using the tools and techniques I learned over the course of the program, I can make your business's data tell stories and produce meaningful business insights, spanning from predictive modeling to optimization. I can build predictive models to automate your business decisions. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist/Software Developer/Web developer with the aim of producing cost-effective outcomes. Starting from May 2021.
