I am an Information Technology graduate from Mumbai, India. Currently pursuing my master's in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. My love for sport and data led to my previous stint of about 10 years at Sportz Interactive. I have over 12.5 years of industry experience and just getting started on Deep Learning. I am very passionate about data and creating scalable transactional/analytical. Long drives and cooking are my ways to pass time. Super excited to see you all. :)
