I am a second year M.S in Data Science student at RIT. I have worked as a Data Analytics Co-op at RIT for the past 5 months, where I extensively utilized Tableau, MS-Excel and SQL to handle and represent data critical to the institute. I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern for 6 months at Symantec Corporation during my undergraduate study in Computer Science.
Over the past 1 and a half years of my graduate study, Iâ€™ve worked with really amazing professors and mentors on coursework and research projects like Prediction of COVID-19 hotspots, Offensive Language Identification and Duplicate Bug Report Identification, etc. These projects were incredibly empowering because I learnt so much about the process of ideation, experimentation, evaluation and presentation of my work. I really enjoy working on data science solutions, because I believe data has truly enormous capabilities and a lot of untapped potential. I am passionate about working on Machine Learning solutions that can impact human life in any way possible.
