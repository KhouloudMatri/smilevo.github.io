Students are encouraged to discuss the advantages as well as the limitations of systems and quantitative approaches, with a view to understanding the importance of interpretation in metrics usage and of matching quality systems choices to organizational objectives and culture. They learn the use of modern metrics such as DRE, PCE, COQ/COPQ, reliability objectives and SUMI scores through exercises in analyzing and interpreting charts. This is complemented with a project where they work in teams to design an appropriate quality system for a specific project/software, and discuss the application and analysis of its evaluation experimentation as a means of improving the quality aspects of subject project/design, testing and maintenance of the software.
